# Personal Color Palette [WIP]

Create your own color palette with this app, based on the process from [a Seamwork article by Elizabeth Farr](https://www.seamworkmag.com/issues/2015/05/design-a-personal-color-palette).

Use the app here: [eheikes.github.io/personal-color-palette](http://eheikes.github.io/personal-color-palette)

## Installation

To build the app, you'll need [Node/npm](https://nodejs.org), [Bower](http://bower.io/), and [gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) installed on your machine.

Then, on the command line, run:

```shell
npm install
bower install
gulp build
```

The app will be compiled into the `dist` folder.

## Contributing

Pull requests are welcome! Please add tests and maintain the existing styling when adding and updating the code.

Gulp tasks that will be useful:

```shell
gulp          # lint, build, and run unit tests
gulp serve    # run a server at http://localhost:8080 and watch for file changes
gulp test     # run all tests (local server must be running)
```
